# Project README

## Overview

This project is a Python-based application that leverages modern machine learning and NLP libraries such as `openai`, `langchain`, `pydantic`, `faiss-cpu`, `transformers`, and more. It is configured for Python 3.11 and designed for data processing, evaluation, and experimentation with various AI models and datasets.

## Features

- Integration with OpenAI GPT models
- Use of LangChain for chaining LLMs and decision processes
- Data processing and evaluation with tools like `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `evaluate`
- Vector search and information retrieval via FAISS
- Visualization with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <repo-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies with Pipenv:**
   ```bash
   pipenv install
   ```

## Usage

Activate the virtual environment and run your application scripts:

```bash
pipenv shell
python <your_script>.py
```

Replace `<your_script>.py` with the name of the Python file you want to run.
